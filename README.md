## 🚀 Project Overview
**TrueSight** is a next-generation web application designed to combat misinformation in the digital age. Unlike standard fact-checkers that rely on black-box databases, TrueSight uses a transparent **heuristic analysis engine** to evaluate text for:
1.  **Linguistic Red Flags**: Emotional manipulation, absolutist language, and sensationalism.
2.  **Logical Fallacies**: Ad hominem attacks, whataboutism, and circular reasoning.
3.  **Source Integrity**: Domain reputation and citation reliability.

It features a cryptographic **Truth Ledger** that generates an immutable SHA-256 hash for every analysis, ensuring that results cannot be tampered with—a critical feature for academic and journalistic integrity.

## ✨ Key Features
*   **🔍 Advanced Text Scanner**: Real-time analysis of text inputs with immediate credibility scoring.
*   **⛓️ Truth Ledger**: A local, immutable history of all analyses protected by **SHA-256 integrity hashing**.
*   **📊 Analytics Dashboard**: Interactive charts visualizing credibility trends and verdict distributions over time.
*   **📄 Professional Reports**: One-click generation of branded **PDF Certificates** for research or documentation.
*   **🎥 Media Intelligence (Simulated)**: A dedicated module demonstrating deepfake detection capabilities for audio and video.
*   **🤖 System Guide**: An integrated AI chatbot assistant to help users navigate the tools.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack
*   **Frontend**: React.js + Vite (High-performance SPA)
*   **Styling**: CSS Modules with "Glassmorphism" Design System & Google Fonts (Outfit/Space Grotesk)
*   **Visualization**: Recharts (Data analytics)
*   **Utilities**: Web Crypto API (Hashing), jsPDF (Report generation)
*   **Hosting**: Client-side deployment (Netlify/Vercel compatible)
